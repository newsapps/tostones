In addition to python requirements, this project requires the installation
of the ruby "table_setter" gem:

% gem install table_setter

If you are using Ruby 1.9, this will bring with it a dependency on FasterCSV,
which inanely forces Ruby to stop executing when it is required in ruby>=1.9

To fix this, find the installed gems for table_setter and table_fu and change

require "fastercsv"
to
require "csv"

and then change references to FasterCSV to CSV
