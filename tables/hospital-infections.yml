    <p>  Recently Illinois published data showing for the first time which hospitals are succeeding in controlling central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) and which are not. These infections, which can be fatal, involve large catheters that doctors place in blood vessels to deliver medications and administer fluids to seriously ill patients.</p>
    <p>The searchable table below lists the number of CLABSIs that occurred at various hospitals in 2009 in adult intensive-care units, as well as two common measures of performance: number of CLABSIs per 1,000 days that central lines were in patients, and the ratio of actual infections to the number of infections that might be expected to occur based on national data.</p>

    <p>Most of the numbers above come from the Illinois Hospital Report Card and Consumer Guide to Health Care. Hospitals reported the data directly to a unit of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which then forwarded it to the Illinois Department of Public Health. Results have not yet been audited. The table is not comprehensive because the report card does not list data for some Illinois hospitals. For missing hospitals in the Chicago area, the Tribune obtained infection data directly from hospital officials. Ratios of actual to expected infections were not available for these hospitals.</p>
      <p>* Figures on infection rates per 1,000 central line days were calculated by the Tribune based on data from the report card or from individual hospitals.</p>
      <p>** Some hospitals have two ICUs of the same type in the same facility. Infection data are reported separately for each ICU.</p>
      <p>*** Centegra Health System officials told the Tribune they had incorrectly reported zero infections for 2009 and the correct figure is 2.</p>
