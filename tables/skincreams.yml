    <p>The Chicago Tribune sent 50 skin-lightening creams and products to a certified lab to be tested for mercury. Six were found to contain amounts banned by federal law. Here is a list of all products tested, including those that showed no mercury in a single test. This does not guarantee that they are mercury-free; tests on different samples of the same cream might yield different results.</p>
