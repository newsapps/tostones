    <p>The Chicago Tribune sent 50 skin-lightening creams and products to a certified lab to be tested for mercury. Six were found to contain amounts banned by federal law. Here is a list of all products tested, including those that showed no mercury in a single test. This does not guarantee that they are mercury-free; tests on different batches of the same cream might yield different results.</p>

    <p>Products were purchased by Chicago Tribune reporters and tested at Columbia Analytical Services, Inc. in Kelso, Wash.</p>
    <p>* Two products had two small containers of cream within their package. Both the white and yellow cream in each package were tested for mercury.<br>
    ** These creams contained less than 1 part per million of mercury, but slightly more than the non-detect level. Because "lightening" or "whitening" is not listed on the packaging, the products are considered cosmetics and can contain 1 part per million of mercury. Lightening and whitening creams cannot contain any mercury. Ly-Na Pearl Face Cream contained .181 parts per million of mercury. San Ing contained .249 ppm.</p>
