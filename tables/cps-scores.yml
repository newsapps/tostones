        <p>Each year, Chicago Public Schools officials score the 680 city schools based on a variety of academic factors, 
        including test scores. The district then figures out the percentage of points received out of the total possible.</p>
        <p>Last year, schools chief Ron Huberman decided to use those percentages to inform decisions on whether schools 
        would be closed. By assigning letter grades based on the scores, the district hoped to better inform the community 
        of where individual buildings stood. The Tribune obtained the grades, which were never publicly released. They paint 
        a grim picture of failure at the school district.</p>
        <p>Schools for which scores arenâ€™t available for either school year in this report are not in this table. Schools 
        for which scores are available for only one of the two years have blanks where no scores are available.</p>
