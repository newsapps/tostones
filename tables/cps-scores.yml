        <p>Each year, the school district gives individual scores to each school based on a variety of academic factors, 
        including annual test scores. The district then figures out the percentage of points received from the total available. 
        Last year, schools chief Ron Huberman decided to use those scores to inform decisions on whether schools would be closed. 
        Staff assigned letter grades to the scores, in an effort to better inform the school community of where they stood. 
        The grades, which were never publicly released, paint a grim picture of failure at the school district.</p> 
        <p>Schools for which scores are available for neither school year are not included in this data. Schools for which scores are 
        available for only one of the two years have blanks in the years for which no scores are available.</p>
